    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "In several instances, network communications can occur with relevant delays, as for extra-terrestial communications or for supervised monitoring networks. In such network deciding which node can communicate with which other node and when is extremely complicated issue (a np-completed scheduling problem).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignments\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generate a series of patterns of transmissions on a network represented as a graph. In such graph the edges are weighted accordingly to the delay between transmittion and reception.\n",
    "2. Implement euristic algorithms to lower the potential of the network, i.e. aiming at minimizing the distance of the communications from their final destination.\n",

    "# Introduction to Delay Tolerant Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) is a relatively new area of research which \n",
    "is rapidly becoming the focus of considerable effort. DTN is an approach\n",
    "to computer architecture that seeks to address the technical issues in \n",
    "heterogeneus networks that may lack continuos network connectivity. The\n",
    "final aim of this developing study area is to tackle problems which the \n",
    "Internet is not able to face.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There's a great variety among the different DTNs: they range from deep \n",
    "space networks to buses driving around mobile wireless hotspots in \n",
    "villages to provide Internet service to kiosks. \n",
    "\n",
    "The big difference from the regular Internet Protocol (IP) is that IP\n",
    "assumes a seamless end-to-end data path instead DTNs are built to account\n",
    "for errors and disconnections. Unlike IP, where heterogeneus networks are \n",
    "connected by assigning each node a common network-layer identifier (IP address),\n",
    "a DTN uses \"naming, layering, encapsulation and persistent storage\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The situations in which we use DTNs are pretty challenging:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The throughput is generally low (we can think for instance about the acoustic in underwater modems) and may \n",
    "be highly asymmetric or in the worse scenario a return channel might not \n",
    "exist\n",
    "\n",
    "* These networks are frequently disconnected, not only by faults but due\n",
    "to motion for instance\n",
    "\n",
    "* These systems frequently operate with a low duty cycle and the queuing \n",
    "time can be very large; with these conditions TCP would time out the session\n",
    "instead UDP would lose all the packets.\n",
    "\n",
    "We decided to use 2 different approaches in order to face to routing problem with DTNs. The first one is a greedy\n",
    "algorithm while the second is an epidemic algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "We decided to model the DTN as a wireless network where at each time step a link has a certain probability of being shut down for a certain amount of time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before going into the details of the two different algorithms there are some assumptions that need to be pointed out:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We are working with infinite buffers \n",
    "\n",
    "* There are no errors in transmission\n",
    "\n",
    "* There's a maximum distance between two satellites beyond which they can't communicate\n",
    "\n",
    "* We keep the same size for every packet and the same bandwidth for each link\n",
    "\n",
    "* This is a centralized system, in the sense that Earth knows all the topology of the network\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulated network is a satellitar network where the nodes need to send data to the main station on Earth, for the sake of semplicity all of them have a direct link to the the destination. This is not an oversemplification because given the fact that links often shut down the overall behaviour is similar to the one we would have in case of indirect communications.\n",
    "\n",
    "We repeated the tests done below also for the latter case but they were not kept. This is due to the fact that since some satellites are too far to directly communicate with the base station it is necessary to increase the number of nodes in order to have a meaningful configuration.\n",
    "Increasing the total number of nodes is prohibitive because both the algorithms are superlinear in the number of nodes, meaning that it takes too much time to execute them in this particular case.\n",
    "In most cases the results were very similar to the one obtained by the simulation, if not it will be specified below."

    "\n",
    "In every network where data is generated from a node and needs to be delivered to a different one, may it be the postal network or the internet, it is necessary to find out the route that the data should follow in order to reach its destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is usually done by a routing algorithm, in the internet the most widely used ones are the Dijikstra and the Bellman-Ford algorithms, these two are used in order to find the shortest path from the source to the destination according to some metric that could be the number of hops, the end to end delay etc.\n",

    "            Path obtained by applying routing between the two nodes\n",
    "        </i>\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "Classical routing algorithms do not work on DTNs (Delay Tolerant Networks) because they were thought for systems where links are supposed to fail very rarely and where the end to end delay is relatively small.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the internet the chance of a link failing is low and even if it does the end to end delay is small, so in case a packet is lost because of link failure sending the packet again is not too expensive.\n",
    "In DTNs this is not true because:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The propagation time is very high, expecially if we are considering satellite communication\n",
    "\n",
    "* The chance of link failure is very high.\n",
    "\n",
    "On top of that it is not even possible to find the best routing algorithm for networks, this is because if also the traffic generated by other nodes is taken into consideration the problem becomes NP.\n",
    "By analyzing the state of the art in DTN it is possible to see that the best results are mostly obtained by using greedy algorithms, i. e. algorithms that take a decision by choosing the best choice at each iteration without considering long term planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main underliying assumptions used in the implementation of the greedy algorithm are:\n",
    "* Full knowledge of the topology and evolution of the network is given. This is not a very strict requirement as it might happen in real life, for example for satellite networks, where usually link failure is caused by the interference of a celestial body, the requirement can be easily satisfied.\n",
    "* One central station (Earth), that fully knows the topology evolution of the network, calculates all the optimal routes beforehand and communicates them to each node. The fact that a central node perfoms all the computations allows for accurate scheduling that avoids collisions so no method has to be emplyed in order to detect them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implemented greedy algorithm chooses the best next hop by using a slightly modified version of the dijkstra algorithm that allows to compute the best path from the source to the destination at a specific point in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since it is also necessary to take collisions into account, if sending one packet causes one, the sender needs to wait until it is sure that no collision will occur. After the idle time waited in order to avoid collisions the optimal path needs to be recomputed because, due to topology changes, it might not be optimal anymore.\n",

    "Usually the algorithm is run on graphs that have fixed topology, unfortunately for DNTs this is not the case, hence a link that was active when the packet was sent might not be active when the packet reaches its destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "This has to be taken into account because a link failing while a message is being sent through the link will result in packet loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "An implementation of the Dijkstra algorithm for DTNs that solved this problem was proposed in [1].\n",
    "With this approach the weight of a node is considered equal to $t_p + t_{tr} + t_w$ where $t_p$ is the propagation time, $t_{tr}$ is the transmission time and $t_w$ is the total time that the sender needs to wait before sending because of link failures.\n",

    "1) What we get in the first plot is that the idle time remains almost equal to zero even if we increase the transmission time a \n",

If we consider the light and unstable mode we can see that the results are very similar, the arrival time though is always higher for the unstable mode as expected; this is because if more links are being shut down it is reasonable to expect a longer arrival time.\n",

    "Here instead we can spot a big difference between light and unstable mode, given by the \n",

    "# Epidemic Algorithm\n",
    "A key problem affecting DTNs is the fact that the topology of network changes a lot over time. In some cases, it is not possible to predict these network changes. For example in our case study, some celestial bodies could suddenly pass between the Earth and our satellites causing the link to fail and we cannot know if and when the link will become active again.<br> \n",
    "The epidemic algorithm suggests an approach that we can use to solve these types of problems,because it does not require a complete previous knowledge of the network topology. The algorithm works like an epidemic; if it is not possible to send packets to Earth, each node spreads the packets to all nearby nodes. So this procedure creates many copies of the same packet, in fact pure Epidemic routing has usually a high message delivery ratio. We can see below the main phases of the algorithm.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "   * 1) If the link is up the packets are sent from the node to the Earth, if the link is down the packets are sent to all nearby nodes that they can reach(the topology of network is locally fully-connected, but it is possible that some links are temporarily interrupted)<br><br>\n",
    "   \n",
    "   * 2) This procedure is repeated for all nodes over time, until all the packets have arrived to Earth. But if a node has already sent a copy of the packets to its neighbour, it doesn't need to send it back.<br><br>\n",
    "   \n",
    "   * 3) It is possible that the packet is discarded. This happens when: the packet is sent but during the propagation time the link breaks or when the packet arrives but there are some collisions on the receiver because other packets arrive in the same moment.  In both cases this is implemented by checking beforehand if it is possible to send the packet, if it is not then the packet is just not sent which is equivalent to discarding the packet midair. In case of collision one of the colliding packets is kept because by using CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) it is actually possible to distinguish between the different signals even if there is interference.<br><br>\n",
    "   \n",
    "Using Epidemic algorithm, unless a node always remains isolated, we are sure that all packets arrive to Earth. The problem is that many copies of the same packet can create a congestion in the network and an increase of total energy consumption for data transmission.\n",
    "In this algorithm we assume to know the topology of network, namely if the links are active or not, only in the current moment in which we are. We have no information about the future, so we cannot route efficiently the packets, like it happens in the algorithms above.\n",

    "1) We can see that the mean arrival time in both cases increases linearly (the x axis is in logarithmical scale) with the number of packets. Normally one would expect to see an exponential trend, what is probably preventing this to happen is the fact that if a node knows that it can send the packet directly to Earth it doesn't send copies around. Even if the number of disabled links is higher than in the unstable case we do not see the exponential trend because the number of nodes that effectively receive the packet is lower since most connections are disabled.\n",
    "It is possible to see that with a bigger number of nodes the arrival time becomes exponential, the analysis was not presented in this notebook because it takes more than one hour just to run one simulation.\n",

    "located very far from each other and the links are not always working. \n",

    "The first strategy which we studied and implemented is a greedy algorithm which turned out to be very efficient and \n",
    "probably the best type of approach when dealing with DTNs.\n",
    "We can say that this algorithm is very efficient because Earth (which is the destination node) is always busy in the\n",
    "sense that there are almost no idle times for the destination node which is always receiving packets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The two main reasons why we also tested the epidemic algorithm were\n",
    "\n",
    "1) It needs much less information about the system to work properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) We thought that because packets are sent everywhere some packets would arrive to Earth faster than they would with the greedy algorithm, this because the greedy algorithm does not keep queues in consideration when computing the best path meaning that some packets may be forced to take strange routes.\n",
    "Unfortunately the amount of duplicate packets was more than enough to overcome this effect making the epidemic algorithm actually way worse.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [1] the authors actually express very clearly the fact that in many cases the epidemic algorithm becomes unfeasible because it fills up the buffers and it generates too many packets.\n",
    "From the simulations though we saw that for small networks where the topology can not be known in advance, this approach might actually work decently well as it takes all the packets to destination."
