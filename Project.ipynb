    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "In several instances, network communications can occur with relevant delays, as for extra-terrestial communications or for supervised monitoring networks. In such network deciding which node can communicate with which other node and when is extremely complicated issue (a np-completed scheduling problem).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignments\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generate a series of patterns of transmissions on a network represented as a graph. In such graph the edges are weighted accordingly to the delay between transmittion and reception.\n",
    "2. Implement euristic algorithms to lower the potential of the network, i.e. aiming at minimizing the distance of the communications from their final destination.\n",
    "3. Find out the most efficient algorithm\n",

    "# Introduction to Delay Tolerant Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) is a relatively new area of research which \n",
    "is rapidly becoming the focus of considerable effort. DTN is an approach\n",
    "to computer architecture that seeks to address the technical issues in \n",
    "heterogeneus networks that may lack continuos network connectivity. The\n",
    "final aim of this developing study area is to tackle problems which the \n",
    "Internet is not able to face.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There's a great variety among the different DTNs: they range from deep \n",
    "space networks to buses driving around mobile wireless hotspots in \n",
    "villages to provide Internet service to kiosks. \n",
    "\n",
    "The big difference from the regular Internet Protocol (IP) is that IP\n",
    "assumes a seamless end-to-end data path instead DTNs are built to account\n",
    "for errors and disconnections. Unlike IP, where heterogeneus networks are \n",
    "connected by assigning each node a common network-layer identifier (IP address),\n",
    "a DTN uses \"naming, layering, encapsulation and persistent storage\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The situations in which we use DTNs are pretty challenging:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The throughput is generally low (we can think for instance about the acoustic in underwater modems) and may \n",
    "be highly asymmetric or in the worse scenario a return channel might not \n",
    "exist\n",
    "\n",
    "* These networks are frequently disconnected, not only by faults but due\n",
    "to motion for instance\n",
    "\n",
    "* These systems frequently operate with a low duty cycle and the queuing \n",
    "time can be very large; with these conditions TCP would time out the session\n",
    "instead UDP would lose all the packets.\n",
    "\n",
    "We decided to use 2 different approaches in order to face to routing problem with DTNs. The first one is a greedy\n",
    "algorithm while the second is an epidemic algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before going into the details of the two different algorithms there are some assumptions that need to be pointed out:\n",
    "    \n",
    "* We are working with infinite buffers \n",
    "\n",
    "* There are no errors in transmission\n",
    "\n",
    "* There's a maximum distance between two satellites beyond which they can't communicate\n",
    "\n",
    "* We keep the same size for every packet\n",
    "\n",
    "* This is a centralized system, in the sense that Earth knows all the topology of the network\n"

    "\n",
    "In every network where data is generated from a node and needs to be delivered to a different one, may it be the postal network or the internet, it is necessary to find out the route that the data should follow in order to reach its destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is usually done by a routing algorithm, in the internet the most widely used ones are the Dijikstra and the Bellman-Ford algorithms, these two are used in order to find the shortest path from the source to the destination according to some metric that could be the number of hops, the end to end delay etc.\n",

    "        </i>\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "Classical routing algorithms do not work on DTNs (Delay Tolerant Networks) because they were thought for systems where links are supposed to fail very rarely and where the end to end delay is relatively small.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the internet the chance of a link failing is low and even if it does the end to end delay is small, so in case a packet is lost because of link failure sending the packet again is not too expensive.\n",
    "In DTNs this is not true because:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The propagation time is very high, expecially if we are considering satellite communication\n",
    "\n",
    "* The chance of link failure is very high.\n",
    "\n",
    "On top of that it is not even possible to find the best routing algorithm for networks, this is because if also the traffic generated by other nodes is taken into consideration the problem becomes NP.\n",
    "By analyzing the state of the art in DTN it is possible to see that the best results are mostly obtained by using greedy algorithms, i. e. algorithms that take a decision by choosing the best choice at each iteration without considering long term planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to perform routing in this work by hypothesis we have full knowledge of the topology and evolution of the network. This is not a very strict requirement as it might happen in real life, for example for satellite networks, where usually link failure is caused by the interference of a celestial body, the requirement can be easily satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first of the two implemented algorithms chooses the best next hop for the packet by using a slightly modified version of the dijkstra algorithm that computes the best path from the source to the destination at a specific point in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also necessary to take collisions into account, so if sending one packet causes one the sender needs to wait until it is sure that no collision will occur. After the idle time waited in order to avoid collisions the optimal path needs to be recomputed because, due to topology changes, it might not be optimal anymore.\n",

    "\n",
    "Usually the algorithm is run on graphs that have fixed topology, unfortunately for DNTs this is not the case, hence a link that was active when the packet was sent might not be active when the packet reaches its destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "This has to be taken into account because a link failing while a message is being sent through the link will result in packet loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "An implementation of the Dijkstra algorithm for DTNs that solved this problem was proposed in [1].\n",
    "With this approach the weight of a node is considered equal to $t_p + t_{tr} + t_w$ where $t_p$ is the propagation time, $t_{tr}$ is the transmission time and $t_w$ is the total time that the sender needs to wait before sending because of link failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pseudo code for the algorithm is:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input = G=(E, V), s, T, w(e,t)\n",
    "Q = V\n",

    "```\n",
    "Where G is the graph representing the network, s is the starting node, T is the starting time, w(e,t) is the weight of edge e at time t.\n",
    "The only difference from the standard algorithm is that in the standard case w(e,t) is constant in t, meaning that by correctly computing the function w(e,t) the algorithm will be able to find shortest paths also in the case of changing topology.\n"

    "## Epidemic Algorithm\n",
    "One of the most important problems in the DTN is the fact that the topology of network changes a lot over time. In same case, it is not possible to predict these network changes. For exemple in our case study, some celestial bodies could suddenly pass between the earth and our sattelites causing the link to fail and we cannot know if and when the link will become active again.<br> \n",
    "The epidemic algorithm suggests an approach that we can use to solve these types of problems,because it does not provide a complete and previous knowledge of the network topology. The algorithm works like an epidemic; if it is not possible send packets to earth, each node spreads the packets to all nearby nodes. So this procedure creates many copies of the same packet, in fact pure Epidemic routing has usually a high message delivery ratio. We can see below the main phases of the algorithm.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "   * 1) If the link is up the packets are sent from the node to the earth, if the link is down the packets are send to all nearby nodes that they can reach(the topology of network is full-connected, but it is possible that same links are temporarily interrupte)<br><br>\n",
    "   \n",
    "   * 2) This procedure is repeated for all nodes over time, until all the packets have arrived to earth. But if a node has already sent a copy of the packets to its neighbor, it hasen't to send it back.<br><br>\n",
    "   \n",
    "   * 3) It is possible that the packet is discarded. This happens when: the packet is send but during the propagation time the link breaks or when the packet arrives but there are same collition on the reciver because other packets arrive in the same moment.<br><br>\n",
    "   \n",
    "Using Epidemic algorithm, unless a node always remains isolated, we are sure that all packets arrive to earth. The problem is that many copies of the same packet can create a congestion in the network and an increase of total energy consumption for data transmission.\n",
    "In this algorithm we assume to know the toplogy of network, namaly if the links are active or not, only in the current moment in which we are. We have not information about the future, so we can not route efficiently the packets, like happens in the algorithms above.\n"

In this case, as we can expected, packet fraction reaches lower values, becuase same nodes can not send the packets to earth directly so the number of copies packets obviously will be increse.<br>\n",
    "With second figure we are visualizing the arrival time as a function of transmission time and the packet delivery ratio using the same configuration as above. We can see that, in case we halve the maximum radius of transmission, the arrival time increses because the network is more congensted.\n"
